# Machbase Neo Tag Analyzer Guide

Tag Analyzer provides a feature to view and analyze data as charts using the rollup functionality of the Tag Table. Tag Analyzer is structured in the form of a dashboard composed of multiple charts, where each column of the dashboard represents a single chart.

## Applicable Tables

The conditions for using Tag Analyzer are as follows:
- Only Tag Tables can be used
- To improve the query speed of the chart, create a Rollup Table in advance
- Since the X-axis interval is automatically determined based on the time range of the chart query, it is recommended to create basic Rollups with intervals of 1 second, 1 minute, and 1 hour

### Example of Creating Tag Table and Rollup Table

```sql
CREATE TAG TABLE tag (NAME VARCHAR(80) PRIMARY KEY, TIME DATETIME BASETIME, VALUE DOUBLE SUMMARIZED);

CREATE ROLLUP _tag_rollup_sec FROM tag INTERVAL 1 SEC;
CREATE ROLLUP _tag_rollup_min FROM _tag_rollup_sec INTERVAL 1 MIN;
CREATE ROLLUP _tag_rollup_hour FROM _tag_rollup_min INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
```

> **Note**: For more details about Tag Tables, refer to the Machbase manual (Feature and Tables > Tag Table).

## Dashboard

### Screen Layout

The dashboard is composed of charts that display actual data. If there are multiple charts, they are displayed in multiple rows, with each row representing a single chart.

1. **Control Area for the Entire Dashboard** - The time range applied to the dashboard is also displayed here
2. **Panel Where Charts Are Displayed** - When a new chart is added, it is positioned below the existing charts
3. **Button to Add a New Chart** - This button is always located in the bottommost row

### Adding a Chart

To create a new chart, click the [+] button located at the bottom of the dashboard.

1. **Select a Table** - Only tables in Tag format are displayed
2. **Filter Tags** - The list of tags will be filtered to include only those containing the input value
3. **Available Tags** - A list of available tags is displayed, with pagination shown at the bottom
4. **Selected Tags** - Selected tags are displayed, and you can change the **Calc. mode**. Since the same tag can have different Calc. mode, duplicates are not checked
5. **Select Chart Type** - Choose the type of chart (area chart, point chart, line chart). The appearance of the chart can be modified in the Display section of the chart settings

> **Calc. mode**: Aggregation functions used in STAT mode (e.g., avg, min, max, sum, count).

### Dashboard Controls

You can control the dashboard using the buttons located at the top of the dashboard.

#### Time Range

The time range applied to the dashboard is displayed. You can set a specific time range manually, as shown in the image, or configure it to synchronize with the current time. (e.g., now: current time, h: hours, m: minutes, s: seconds)

**Example**: now-3h = Current time â€“ 3 hours

#### Control Buttons

1. **Reload Data** - Reloads the data and updates the charts. The time range and selection of the chart slide remain unchanged
2. **Reset and Reload** - Reloads the data and updates the charts. The time range and selection of the chart slide revert to their original settings
3. **Save** - Saves the Tag Analyzer dashboard with the file extension ".taz"
4. **Save As** - Saves the Tag Analyzer dashboard with a new name
5. **Overlap Chart** - Displays an Overlap Chart (Refer to "Overlap Chart")
6. **Set Time Range** - Set the time range for the query. This time range applies to the entire dashboard (except when a time range is set separately in the chart settings)

**Time Range Options**:
- The time range can use now or last:
  - **now**: The current time
  - **last**: The last time of the stored data
- Clicking an item in the Quick Range will set the From/To fields to the corresponding time period

#### Overlap Chart

The Overlap Chart feature allows you to compare multiple charts by overlaying their graphs onto a single chart.

1. **Select Charts** - Click on the chart title to select the charts you want to compare. Selected charts will have a highlighted border
   - Only charts with a single series can be used for the Overlap Chart
   - The time range of the first chart clicked will be applied to the Overlap Chart, and an icon will appear in front of the chart title to indicate this
2. **Create Overlap** - Click the Overlap Chart button to overlay the selected charts into a single chart
   - You can fine-tune the time range for each tag individually when querying

## Chart

### Screen Layout

At the top of the chart, the time range of the currently displayed graph, the time interval of the x-axis ticks, and function buttons are displayed. At the bottom, there is a slider for selecting the time range to zoom in on within the dashboard's time range, along with the legend for the tags used in the chart.

1. **Chart Time Range** - The time range of the chart is displayed. You can select a specific portion of the dashboard's time range for a detailed view using the slider. The interval indicates the time interval of the x-axis ticks
2. **Function Buttons** - Function buttons for controlling each chart are displayed:
   - a. Reload the data to update the chart
   - b. Redraw the chart. The time range and selection of the chart slide revert to their original settings
   - c. Modify the chart settings (refer to "Chart Settings")
   - d. Delete the chart
   - e. Switch to "**RAW Data Mode**"
   - f. Stat Query: Select the button and drag on the chart to display the stats. The FFT Chart functionality can also be used here
3. **Chart Display Area** - The area where the actual chart is displayed
4. **Slider Time Range** - Displays the time range of the slider used to select the time range for querying. The < > buttons shift the specified time range by 50%
5. **Slider Controls** - Controls the slider and the selected range:
   - a. The selected range on the slider expands by 12.5% (x2) or 25% (x4) on both sides. The time range displayed on the chart expands(making the slider bar larger)
   - b. The selected range on the slider shrinks by 12.5% (x2) or 25% (x4) on both sides. The time range displayed on the chart decreases(making the slider bar smaller)
   - c. The chart's time range changes to match the entire time range of the slider, and the selected area of the slider is centered with a size of 50% of the slider's length. This is used to view the chart's data in greater detail
6. **Slider Bar** - Move or resize the slider to set the range currently queried on the chart
7. **Legend** - The legend displays the data series shown on the chart. Clicking on a series in the legend toggles it on or off

#### RAW Data Mode

**RAW Data mode** uses raw data stored in the database without applying the calc mode. If the number of selected data points exceeds the value calculated using the "Pixels between tick marks" setting, the queried time range will be adjusted, and the selected range on the slider will be updated accordingly.

### FFT Chart

The "FFT Chart" feature becomes available when using the stat query function to retrieve stats for a selected range.

When querying stats, the "FFT Chart" button becomes available for use.

You can configure settings to view the FFT Chart:
1. Select the tag for which you want to view the FFT chart
2. Enter the range for Hz (set to 0 to disable)
3. Choose between 2D or 3D chart. For the 3D chart, a time axis will be added
4. Generate the FFT chart based on the entered conditions

### Chart Settings

The settings of the currently viewed chart will be changed.

1. **Preview** - Displays the chart being configured. After changing the settings, you can view the changes by clicking the [Apply] button
2. **Configuration Tabs** - The tab to select which field to modify:
   - **General**: Modify general chart settings
   - **Data**: Modify the tags used in the chart
   - **Axes**: Change the settings for the X-axis and Y-axis
   - **Display**: Modify settings related to the appearance of the chart
   - **Time range**: Set the time range specific to the chart
3. **Settings Area** - Area to modify values
4. **Button Display Area**:
   - **Apply**: Apply the changes to the chart. You can cancel by clicking the [Cancel] button
   - **Ok**: Apply the changes and exit the settings mode (only the changes from pressing [Apply] will be applied)
   - **Cancel**: Cancel the changes and exit the settings mode
